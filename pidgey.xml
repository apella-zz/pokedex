'''Pidgey''' (Japanese: '''ポッポ''' ''Poppo'') is a {{type|Normal}}/{{type|Flying}}-[[Types|type]] [[Pokémon (species)|Pokémon]] introduced in [[Generation I]].

== Appearance ==
[[File:Oak's Pidgey.png|thumb|right.|A Pidgey with Professor Oak.]]
Pidgey resembles a small, plump-bodied bird. It is a brown color, with a lighter colored throat and belly. The tips of its wings share this cream color. Both its feet and beak are a pinkish-gray color. Its plumage is fairly nondescript, particularly compared to its evolutions, Pidgeotto and Pidgeot. It has black markings around its eyes and a small crest of brown and cream feathers above its eyes. It resembles other small flying-type Pokémon, such as [[Starly]], [[Taillow]], and [[Spearow]]. However, due to the fact that these Pokémon tend to be unique to a region, with the exception of Spearow, it is likely that they are a result of convergent evolution. Pidgey's feet allow it to walk on the ground for a while, but can also reach out and safely land on perches.

== Special abilities ==
When on the ground, Pidgey flaps its wings to kick up sand and dust that blinds its opponents. It has an excellent sense of direction and homing instincts. It can locate its nest even when far removed from familiar surroundings. These skills enable to be easily trained to deliver messages.

== In the anime ==
Pidgeys often appear in the [[Pokémon Anime|anime series]]. They debuted in the first episode, ''[[IL001: Pokémon - I Choose You!|Pokémon - I Choose You!]]'', where [[Ash Ketchum]] had attempted to catch one without [[Ash's Pikachu|Pikachu]]'s help. He later mistook a [[Spearow]] for a Pidgey, which caused a flock of [[Spearow]] to chase him.

Pidgey later appeared as the main Pokémon in ''[[JE095: Fly Me to the Moon|Fly Me to the Moon]]'', where Ash and friends find an island of fat Pidgey that could not fly.

== Evolution ==
Pidgey [[Evolution|evolves]] into [[Pidgeotto]] at level 18, Then it evolves into [[Pidgeot]] at level 36.
